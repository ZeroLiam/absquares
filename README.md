# absquares
I doodle square while I'm thinking how to debug a project. Today I'm bored and I'm making a simple game out of it.

## Frameworks
This is a ReactJS app. During development I will add a guide here.

# FAQ
## Why did you do this?
I'm bored and I need to justify my time at work. I mean, if I'm doodling anyway, why not code a game? I will be fired for doodling, not for coding.

## Wanna play?
Let me finish this first and then publish it on my blog. In the meantime, download it, go to the folder and do an `npm start` in your terminal.

## Enjoy!
